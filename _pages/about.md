I am a scientist with experience in physics, programming, engineering, and cellular biology.  Past research I've been involved with includes investigating a gene linked with certain cancers, searching Earth's magnetosphere for novel phenomena, identifying particle interaction events and separating them from background interactions, and examining the properties of superconductors.  During my education I was also given the opportunity to teach in a variety of capacities, ranging from tutoring math and physics for students with all sorts of backgrounds to mentoring research projects for advanced physics students.

I am currently developing my data science and machine learning skills and am looking for a new position.  Reach out to me at sobek.joe.d@gmail.com if you'd like to connect or share any interesting facts.  I'm always looking to learn something new.
