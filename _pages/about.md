My background is primarily as a physicist, but I've dabbled throughout my education and work history in several other disciplines.  I am currently working as a Data Science Analyst at Mayo Clinic Rochester, primarily working with deep learning and medical imaging.  Reach out to me at sobek.joe.d@gmail.com if you'd like to connect or share any interesting facts.
